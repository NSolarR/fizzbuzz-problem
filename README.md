## What is this project
    This project is just my attempt at solving the
    fizzbuzz problem to test my understanding of javascript.
    
## Pre project thoughts
    Shouldn't be too difficult. Breaking it down it seems pretty straight forward:
    
    -Ask user to input a number then use a for loop to increase number from 1 until it
    reaches the users input. 
    -Then each time the number is increased use the remainder operator
    (%) to test if the number is  divisible by 3, 5, neither, or both.
    -Print either the number, or fizz if divisble by 3, buzz if divisible by 5
    and fizzbuzz if divisble by both 3 and 5.
    
## Post project thoughts
    Was just as simple as I thought. Not really much to add here as i didn't have any trouble.
    In the future i definitely need to learn more on how to have js affect the html elements
    on screen to make stuff look prettier though. Right now the interface is awful
    but it serves its purpose to simply run the fizzbuzz function.
