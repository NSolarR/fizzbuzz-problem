What is this project:
    This project is just my attempt at soling the
    fizzbuzz problem to test my understanding of javascript.
    
Pre project thoughts:
    Shouldn't be too difficult. Breaking it down it seems pretty straight forward.
    
    Ask user to input a number then use a for loop to increase number from 1 until it
    reaches the users input. 
    Then each time the number is increased use the remainder operator
    (%) to test if the number is  divisible by 3, 5, neither, or both.
    Print either the number, or fizz if divisble by 3, buzz if divisible by 5
    and fizzbuzz if divisble by both 3 and 5.
